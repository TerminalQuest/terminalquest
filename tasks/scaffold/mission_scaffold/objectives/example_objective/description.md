# Another Dimension

Inside one of the secure cargo holds in the **Infinite Loop**, you find one of the security nodes you need to disable to reach the TerminalQuest program's electrical engineer. 

This node is currently locked down because of two incorrectly configured environment variables, which are contained within a **two-dimensional array**.

You'll need to assign the right values for these variables in order to hack the node and retrieve the missing index for the **Infinite Loop** master password.

## Understanding 2D arrays

To complete this challenge, consider the following [two-dimensional array](https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/javascript-multi-dimensional-arrays-7186e8edd03).

```js
const twoDimensionalArray = [
  ['dogs', 'cats', 'zebras'],
  ['pizza', 'tacos', 'kale'],
  ['baseball', 'football', 'hockey']
];
```

The text fields on the right ask you for the values at two different indexes. Once you work out what those values are, enter them in the appropriate fields and click the *HACK* button.
